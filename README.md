# World Affairs Conference Registration System

*Using React, Firebase, reactstrap*

#### Getting Started:

Run the following command:

```bash
./build.sh
```

**THE ABOVE CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK. SETUP FIREBASE KEYS IN `./shell/setup.sh`.**

When it asks for your Firebase API Key, paste that in. You'll need access to a valid Firebase Plan to run a local instance of this server.
