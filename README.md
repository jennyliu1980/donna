# World Affairs Conference Registration System

*Using React, Firebase, reactstrap*

More documentation coming soon.

#### Getting Started:

We're using Node version 8.4 - pick it up from the Node website or use nvm.

Run the following commands:

```bash
npm run setup
PORT=XXXX npm start
```

Change `XXXX` to your desired port. If you do not set a port the server will default to 3000

When it asks for your Firebase API Key, paste that in. You'll need access to a valid Firebase Plan to run a local instance of this server.

The server will output to `http://127.0.0.1` on the port that you set.
